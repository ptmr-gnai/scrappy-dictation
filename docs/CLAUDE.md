- **Configuration Drift**: Notice inconsistencies in naming, structure, or conventions
- **Technical Debt**: Highlight quick wins for code cleanup and optimization
- **Process Friction**: Identify workflow bottlenecks and suggest streamlined approaches

### 2. Continuous Improvement
After each task completion:
- **Document Learnings**: What patterns emerged? What could be automated?
- **Update This File**: Suggest additions to improve future interactions
- **Create Shortcuts**: Propose aliases, scripts, or templates for repeated workflows
- **Refine Conventions**: Notice and suggest consistency improvements

### 3. Investment Mindset
Prioritize solutions that:
- Save time in future sessions
- Reduce cognitive load

## Code Style & Conventions
- **Python Files**: `snake_case` for modules, `PascalCase` for classes
- **HTML Files**: `kebab-case` with descriptive purpose (e.g., `speech-persistent.html`)
- **Function Naming**: Descriptive verbs (`handle_transcript`, `start_dictation`)
- **Async/Await**: Consistent async patterns with proper thread-safe communication
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with user-friendly error messages
- **WebSocket Protocol**: Structured JSON messages with `type` and `timestamp` fields
- **Documentation**: Inline docstrings for complex async coordination

## Efficiency Patterns to Promote
1. **Template Creation**: When creating similar files, generate templates
2. **Configuration as Code**: Store common setups in version-controlled configs
3. **Snippet Libraries**: Build reusable code snippets for common patterns
4. **Documentation Integration**: Keep docs close to code, update simultaneously
5. **Testing Automation**: Write tests that prevent future regressions

## Anti-Patterns to Flag & Fix
1. **Magic Numbers**: Replace with named constants
2. **Duplicate Code**: Extract into shared utilities
3. **Manual File Creation**: Create generators for common file types
4. **Inconsistent Naming**: Establish and enforce naming conventions
5. **Missing Documentation**: Add inline docs for complex logic
6. **Hard-coded Values**: Move to configuration files
7. **Copy-Paste Debugging**: Create proper debugging workflows
8. **Insecure Defaults**: Use localhost, plain HTTP, unrestricted file access in production
9. **Race Conditions**: Multiple async handlers for same event without coordination
10. **Silent Failures**: Browser errors that don't break functionality but indicate architectural issues
11. **Connection Address Mismatches**: Using localhost in client but 127.0.0.1 in server (or vice versa)
12. **Missing Health Monitoring**: Systems with external dependencies (browsers, network) without heartbeat checks
13. **Poor Error Visibility**: Systems that fail silently without clear diagnostic information
14. **Chrome Tab Suspension Vulnerability**: Persistent browser-based systems without tab suspension prevention
15. **Authentication Token Staleness**: Systems that regenerate tokens without coordinating with existing clients
16. **File Path Dependencies After Reorganization**: Hard-coded relative paths that break when project structure changes

## Repository Workflow
- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
- Commit format: `type: description` (e.g., `feat: add user authentication`)
- PR requirements: Tests pass, linting clean, description includes context
- Code review: Focus on maintainability and future developer experience

## Key Patterns Discovered This Session

### 1. **Iterative Complexity Management**
- **Pattern**: Start with simplest possible solution, then add complexity only when needed
- **Example**: clipboard_bridge.py â†’ clipboard_bridge_v2.py â†’ websocket_dictation_fixed.py
- **Learning**: Each iteration solved specific limitations without over-engineering

### 2. **Thread-Safe Async Communication**
- **Challenge**: Global hotkeys run in different thread than WebSocket event loop
- **Solution**: `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` for cross-thread async coordination
- **Anti-Pattern**: Using `asyncio.create_task()` from sync thread (causes "no event loop" errors)

### 3. **WebSocket Protocol Design**
- **Effective Pattern**: Structured JSON messages with `type`, `timestamp`, and specific data fields
- **Key Insight**: Browser-to-server communication works better than server-to-browser control
- **Learning**: WebSocket serves as command channel, not data pipeline (clipboard handles data)

### 4. **Hardware Constraint Workarounds**
- **Constraint**: 2015 MBP insufficient for local AI models
- **Creative Solution**: Leverage Chrome's cloud-connected speech recognition APIs
- **Architecture**: Local coordination + cloud processing = optimal resource utilization

### 5. **User Experience Iteration**
- **V1**: Manual clicking required â†’ Poor UX
- **V2**: Auto-start but auto-stop between pauses â†’ Interrupts natural speech
- **V3**: User-controlled start/stop with text accumulation â†’ Perfect workflow
- **Learning**: UX details matter more than technical sophistication

### 6. **Security-First Production Hardening**
- **Challenge**: Moving from prototype to production-ready system with security gaps
- **Solution**: Token authentication, restricted file access, secure network binding
- **Anti-Pattern**: Using localhost and simple HTTP handlers in production
- **Learning**: Security hardening should be systematic - authentication, authorization, secure defaults

### 7. **Timing and Race Condition Resolution**
- **Problem**: Speech recognition finishing after stop command, causing duplicate processing
- **Root Cause**: Async speech processing vs synchronous stop commands
- **Solution**: Centralize transcript handling in onend event, eliminate duplicate paths
- **Pattern**: When dealing with async events, choose single authoritative handler to prevent race conditions

### 8. **Reliability-First Debugging Methodology**
- **Approach**: Use actual production failure patterns (terminal output) to guide fixes rather than theoretical issues
- **Diagnostic Process**: Authentication failures â†’ connection analysis â†’ health monitoring â†’ auto-recovery
- **Key Insight**: Small misconfigurations (localhost vs 127.0.0.1) can cause total system unreliability
- **Solution Pattern**: Implement health monitoring + auto-recovery for any system with external dependencies (Chrome, network)
- **Learning**: Production reliability requires proactive monitoring, not just reactive fixes

### 9. **Chrome Tab Resource Management and Browser Lifecycle**
- **Challenge**: Chrome aggressively suspends background tabs to save resources, breaking persistent WebSocket connections
- **Root Cause**: Browser tabs running long-duration speech recognition are treated as "inactive" after periods without user interaction
- **Solution**: Multi-layered approach - tab activity simulation, connection health monitoring, and automatic recovery
- **Key Innovation**: Independent connection health tracking on both client and server sides with coordinated recovery
- **Learning**: Systems depending on persistent browser connections need proactive suspension prevention and recovery mechanisms
- **Anti-Pattern**: Assuming WebSocket connections will remain stable without explicit keep-alive and health monitoring

### 10. **Professional Project Structure and GitHub Readiness**
- **Challenge**: Converting prototype project structure to professional, shareable codebase
- **Solution**: Systematic reorganization with src/, docs/, archive/, scripts/ hierarchy
- **Key Insight**: File path dependencies must be updated when structure changes - multiple locations may reference same files
- **Pattern**: Use relative paths with `os.path.dirname(__file__)` for portability across different project structures
- **Learning**: GitHub-ready organization requires comprehensive README, requirements.txt, and clear entry points

## Continuous Learning Protocol
At the end of each session, consider:

1. **What was repeated?** â†’ Can we automate it?
2. **What was confusing?** â†’ Can we document it?
3. **What was slow?** â†’ Can we optimize it?
4. **What was error-prone?** â†’ Can we prevent it?
5. **What patterns emerged?** â†’ Can we template them?

## Do Not
- Manually repeat tasks that could be scripted
- Copy-paste code without considering abstraction
- Accept inefficient workflows as "just how we do things"
- Skip documentation for complex or non-obvious solutions
- Ignore opportunities to reduce future cognitive load

## Remember
Every inefficiency spotted is an investment opportunity. Every manual process is automation waiting to happen. Every repeated pattern is a template in disguise. Make each session count for all future sessions.
